SkyBox Ltd. Is a private company that owns a number of jet airplanes that they use to ferry wellpaying customers between international destinations. 
Every airplane has a maximum of 12 seats (not including seats for the pilots and other crew). The company needs help with a solution for keeping
track of passenger manifests. A customer might call SkyBox and say that they need, for example, to
send 9 people from London to Madrid the following Wednesday. However, between the initial call and takeoff, plans can change, people can get sick, 
and the manifest thus needs to be changed as well.
You have been hired to create a simple application for managing the passenger manifest.
Object Oriented Analysis resulted in a class for Passenger:

Passengers are to be stored in an Array of length 12.

Your program must implement the following functionality:
• Insert passenger The system takes information about passenger name and age from the user
and inserts the passenger in the first available seat.
• Remove passenger The system takes a seat number from the user, and removes the
passenger on that seat from the manifest
• Switch seats The system takes two seat numbers as input from the user, and switches out
the passengers so that the passenger that was occupying the first seat now occupies the
second, and vice versa.
• Rename passenger Mistakes can happen during data entry, and the system must be able to
re-name passengers. The system takes a seat number, and a passenger name and updates
the name for the passenger with the given seat number
• Count passengers prints the current number of passengers in the manifest
